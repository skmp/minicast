"""
Symbolize minicast jit frames in perf output.

perf cannot do this itself: the code cache lives inside SH4_TCB, a static array in
.text of minicast.elf, so perf resolves jit addresses against the binary and never
consults a perf-<pid>.map. This joins `perf script` text output against the map
written by perf_map.cpp instead, which avoids perf's symbolization entirely.

    perf script -i perf.data -F ip,sym,dso > samples.txt
    symbolize_perf.py samples.txt /tmp/jit.map minicast.elf

The map records *runtime* addresses; perf script reports offsets within the binary.
The two differ by a constant, which is recovered from the ELF rather than assumed:
SH4_TCB's vaddr is known from the symbol table, and the map's addresses all fall
inside SH4_TCB, so the lowest map address anchors the runtime base.

With --by-shop the third argument is a shop map (MINICAST_SHOP_MAP) instead of a
perf map, and cost is totalled per shil opcode across every block rather than per
block:

    MINICAST_SHOP_MAP=/tmp/shop.map ./minicast.elf ...
    symbolize_perf.py --by-shop samples.txt /tmp/shop.map minicast.elf
