	TA data ring buffer

	Producer: the "ta fsm" (ta.cpp) parses TA data, copies each 32-byte block
	into this ring and, on end-of-list, spin-waits for it to drain before
	raising the list interrupt.

	Consumer: lxdream's tacore drains the ring on its own thread/core and feeds
	pvr2_ta_process_block().

	This is a Cortex-A9 (dual core) target, so the single-producer /
	single-consumer hand-off is ordered with DMB ISH. The barrier is NOT taken
	per block - on an A9 a dmb ish is a serializing ~30-cycle bubble, and taking
	one per 32-byte block dominated the SQ path. Instead the producer copies
	blocks and bumps a private write cursor with plain stores, then publishes
	the whole batch with a single barrier via ta_ring_publish():
	  Producer: write data..., then DMB ISH, then store the shared write index.
	  Consumer: read the shared write index, then DMB ISH, then read the data.

	False sharing is avoided by keeping the producer- and consumer-owned indices
	on separate cache lines, and by each side caching the other's index so the
	steady-state fill/empty checks don't touch the shared line.
